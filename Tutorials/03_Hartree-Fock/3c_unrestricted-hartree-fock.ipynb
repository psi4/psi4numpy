    "# Unrestricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two tutorials in this module, we wrote programs which implement a closed-shell formulation of Hartree-Fock theory using restricted orbitals, aptly named Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF).  In this tutorial, we will abandon strictly closed-shell systems and the notion of restricted orbitals, in favor of a more general theory known as Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) which can accommodate more diverse molecules.  In UHF, the orbitals occupied by spin up ($\\alpha$) electrons and those occupied by spin down ($\\beta$) electrons no longer have the same spatial component, e.g., \n",

    "In any SCF program, there will be several common elements which can be abstracted from the program itself into separate modules, classes, or functions to 'clean up' the code that will need to be written explicitly; examples of this concept can be seen throughout the Psi4NumPy reference implementations.  For the purposes of this tutorial, we can achieve some degree of code cleanup without sacrificing readabilitiy and clarity by focusing on abstracting only the parts of the code which are both \n",

    "\n",
    "In our UHF program, let's use what we've learned in the last tutorial by also implementing DIIS convergence accelleration for our SCF iterations.  With this in mind, two subroutines in particular would benefit from abstraction are\n",

    "2. Extrapolate previous trial vectors for new DIIS solution vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start writing our UHF program, let's try to write functions which can perform the above tasks so that we can use them in our implementation of UHF.  Recall that defining functions in Python has the following syntax:\n",

    "    # function block\n",
    "    return return_values\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "A thorough discussion of defining functions in Python can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions \"Go to Python docs\").  First, let's write a function which can diagonalize the Fock matrix and return the orbital coefficient matrix **C** and the density matrix **D**.  From our RHF tutorial, this subroutine is executed with:\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "F_p =  A.dot(F).dot(A)\n",
    "e, C_p = np.linalg.eigh(F_p)\n",
    "C = A.dot(C_p)\n",

    "D = np.einsum('pi,qi->pq', C_occ, C_occ, optimize=True)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "Examining this code block, there are three quantities which must be specified beforehand:\n",
    "- Fock matrix, **F**\n",
    "- Orthogonalization matrix, ${\\bf A} = {\\bf S}^{-1/2}$\n",
    "- Number of doubly occupied orbitals, `ndocc`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the orthogonalization matrix **A** is a static quantity (only built once, then left alone) we may choose to leave **A** as a *global* quantity, instead of an argument to our function.  In the cell below, using the code snippet given above, write a function `diag_F()` which takes **F** and the number of orbitals `norb` as arguments, and returns **C** and **D**:"
