    "# Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving systems of linear (or nonlinear) equations, iterative methods are often employed.  Unfortunately, such methods often suffer from convergence issues such as numerical instability, slow convergence, and significant computational expense when applied to difficult problems.  In these cases, convergence accelleration methods may be applied to both speed up, stabilize and/or reduce the cost for the convergence patterns of these methods, so that solving such problems become computationally tractable.  One such method is known as the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) method, which is commonly applied to address convergence issues within self consistent field computations in Hartree-Fock theory (and other iterative electronic structure methods).  In this tutorial, we'll introduce the theory of DIIS for a general iterative procedure, before integrating DIIS into our previous implementation of RHF.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "DIIS is a widely applicable convergence acceleration method, which is applicable to numerous problems in linear algebra and the computational sciences, as well as quantum chemistry in particular.  Therefore, we will introduce the theory of this method in the general sense, before seeking to apply it to SCF.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that for a given problem, there exist a set of trial vectors $\\{\\mid{\\bf p}_i\\,\\rangle\\}$ which have been generated iteratively, converging toward the true solution, $\\mid{\\bf p}^f\\,\\rangle$.  Then the true solution can be approximately constructed as a linear combination of the trial vectors,\n",
    "$$\\mid{\\bf p}\\,\\rangle = \\sum_ic_i\\mid{\\bf p}_i\\,\\rangle,$$\n",
    "where we require that the residual vector \n",

    "$$\\sum_i c_i = 1.$$\n",
    "This constraint on the expansion coefficients can be seen by noting that each trial function ${\\bf p}_i$ may be represented as an error vector applied to the true solution, $\\mid{\\bf p}^f\\,\\rangle + \\mid{\\bf e}_i\\,\\rangle$.  Then\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Convergence results in a minimization of the error (causing the second term to vanish); for the DIIS solution vector $\\mid{\\bf p}\\,\\rangle$ and the true solution vector $\\mid{\\bf p}^f\\,\\rangle$ to be equal, it must be that $\\sum_i c_i = 1$.  We satisfy our condition for the residual vector by minimizing its norm,\n",

    "5. Solve Pulay equation for coefficients $\\{c_i\\}$\n",
    "6. Compute DIIS solution vector $\\mid{\\bf p}\\,\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "For SCF iteration, the most common choice of trial vector is the Fock matrix **F**; this choice has the advantage over other potential choices (e.g., the density matrix **D**) of **F** not being idempotent, so that it may benefit from extrapolation.  The residual vector is commonly chosen to be the orbital gradient in the AO basis,\n",
    "$$g_{\\mu\\nu} = ({\\bf FDS} - {\\bf SDF})_{\\mu\\nu},$$\n",
    "however the better choice (which we will make in our implementation!) is to orthogonormalize the basis of the gradient with the inverse overlap metric ${\\bf A} = {\\bf S}^{-1/2}$:\n",
