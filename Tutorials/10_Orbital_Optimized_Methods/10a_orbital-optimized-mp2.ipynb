    "\n",
    "It can be shown that $\\textbf{X} = -\\textbf{A}^{-1}\\textbf{w}$, which gives us the equation used in the Newton-Raphson step of the orbital optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define the unitary rotation matrix to be $\\textbf{U} = exp(\\textbf{X}-\\textbf{X}^\\dagger)$ and use this to rotate the orbitals (using the cofficient matrix). \n",

    "We then transform the 1 and 2-electron integrals using the new cofficient matrix and evaluate the energy. \n",
