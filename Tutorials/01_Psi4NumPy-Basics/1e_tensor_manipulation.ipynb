    "# Tensor Manipulation: Psi4 and NumPy manipulation routines\n",
    "Contracting tensors together forms the core of the Psi4NumPy project. First let us consider the popluar [Einstein Summation Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) which allows for very succinct descriptions of a given tensor contraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us consider a [inner (dot) product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product):\n",
    "$$c = \\sum_{ij} A_{ij} * B_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Einstein convention, all indices that are repeated are considered summed over, and the explicit summation symbol is dropped:\n",
    "$$c = A_{ij} * B_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be extended to [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication):\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\rm{Conventional}\\;\\;\\;  C_{ik} &= \\sum_{j} A_{ij} * B_{jk} \\\\\n",
    "\\rm{Einstein}\\;\\;\\;  C &= A_{ij} * B_{jk} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the $C$ matrix has *implied* indices of $C_{ik}$ as the only repeated index is $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many cases where this notation fails. Thus we often use the generalized Einstein convention. To demonstrate let us examine a [Hadamard product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)):\n",
    "$$C_{ij} = \\sum_{ij} A_{ij} * B_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is nearly identical to the dot product above, and is not able to be written in pure Einstein convention. The generalized convention allows for the use of indices on the left hand side of the equation:\n",
    "$$C_{ij} = A_{ij} * B_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually it should be apparent within the context the exact meaning of a given expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we also make use of Matrix notation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\rm Matrix}\\;\\;\\;  \\bf{D} &= \\bf{A B C} \\\\\n",
    "{\\rm Einstein}\\;\\;\\;  D_{il} &= A_{ij} B_{jk} C_{kl}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this notation is signified by the use of bold characters to denote matrices and consecutive matrices next to each other imply a chain of matrix multiplications! "
