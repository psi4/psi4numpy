    "Below are summarized several commonly computed quantities and how to obtain them using a `MintsHelper` class method:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Quantity | Function | Description |\n",
    "|----------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| AO Overlap integrals | [mints.ao_overlap()](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#psi4.core.MintsHelper.ao_overlap \"Go to Documentation\") | Returns AO overlap matrix as a `psi4.core.Matrix` object |\n",
    "| AO Kinetic Energy | [mints.ao_kinetic()](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#psi4.core.MintsHelper.ao_kinetic \"Go to Documentation\") | Returns AO kinetic energy matrix as a `psi4.core.Matrix` object |\n",
    "| AO Potential Energy | [mints.ao_potential()](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#psi4.core.MintsHelper.ao_potential \"Go to Documentation\") | Returns AO potential energy matrix as a `psi4.core.Matrix` object |\n",
    "| AO Electron Repulsion Integrals | [mints.ao_eri()](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#psi4.core.MintsHelper.ao_eri \"Go to Documentation\") | Returns AO electron repulsion integrals as a `psi4.core.Matrix` object \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, any of these `psi4.core.Matrix` objects can be accessed as NumPy arrays, which is the preferred \n",
    "method in Psi4NumPy.  For a Psi4 matrix `A`, we can access a NumPy view using `np.asarray(A)` or `A.np`, or we can make a\n",
    "copy of the matrix using `np.array(A)`.  This works as one would expect, converting square matrices into rank-2 NumPy \n",
    "arrays, for the overlap (S), kinetic energy (T), and potential energy (V) matrices.  In Psi4, the electron repulsion integrals \n",
    "(ERIs) are handled somewhat differently; `mints.ao_eri()` returns the rank-4 ERI tensor packed into a 2D matrix.  If the \n",
    "four indices of the ERI are p, q, r, s, then this element of the Psi4 Matrix can be accessed by first computing composite \n",
    "indices `pq = p * nbf + q` and `rs = r * nbf + s`, and then accessing element `A.get(pq,rs)`.  However, for convenience, \n",
    "the NumPy view is a rank-4 tensor, and a particular ERI is more simply accessed like this:\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "I = np.asarray(mints.ao_eri())\n",
    "val = I[p][q][r][s]\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these methods, another which is worth mentioning is the [`MintsHelper.mo_eri()`](http://psicode.org\n",
    "/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#psi4.core.MintsHelper.mo_eri \"Go to Documentation\") function, which can transform \n",
    "the four-index, two-electron repulsion integrals from the atomic orbital (AO) to the molecular orbital (MO) basis,\n",
    "which will be important in MP2 theory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward to computing any 1- or 2-electron integrals, we must first discuss the memory requirements of\n",
    "these objects.  Whenever these quantities are computed, they are stored directly in memory (a.k.a. RAM,\n",
    "*not* on the hard drive) which, for a typical laptop or personal computer, usually tops out at around 16 GB of \n",
    "space.  The storage space required by the two-index AO overlap integrals and four-index ERIs scales as ${\\cal O}(N^2)$ \n",
    "and ${\\cal O}(N^4)$, respectively, where $N$ is the number of AO basis functions.  This means that for a\n",
    "system with 500 AO basis functions, while the AO overlap integrals will only require 1 MB of memory to store,\n",
    "the ERIs will require a staggering **500 GB** of memory!! This can be reduced to **62.5 GB** of memory if integral permutational symmetry is used. \n",
    "However, this complicates the bookkeeping, and is not used in the `mints` functions discussed above.  For this reason, as well as the steep computational \n",
    "scaling of many of the methods demonstrated here, we limit ourselves to small systems ($\\sim50$ basis functions)\n",
    "which should not require such egregious amounts of memory.  Additionally, we will employ a \"memory check\" to catch\n",
    "any case which could potentially try to use more memory than is available:\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "# Memory check for ERI tensor\n",
    "I_size = (nbf**4) * 8.e-9\n",
    "print('Size of the ERI tensor will be %4.2f GB.' % (I_size))\n",
    "memory_footprint = I_size * 1.5\n",
    "if I_size > numpy_memory:\n",
    "    psi4.core.clean()\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"Estimated memory utilization (%4.2f GB) exceeds allotted memory \\\n",
    "                     limit of %4.2f GB.\" % (memory_footprint, numpy_memory))\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "In this example, we have somewhat arbitrarily assumed that whatever other matrices we may need, in total their memory\n",
    "requirement will not exceed 50% of the size of the ERIs (hence, the total memory footprint of `I_size * 1.5`)\n",
    "Using the `numpy_memory` variable, we are able to control whether the ERIs will be computed, based on the amount of\n",
    "memory required to store them. \n",
