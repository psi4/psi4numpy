    "# Introduction to the Spin Orbital Formulation of Post-HF Methods\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-HF methods such as MPn, coupled cluster theory, and configuration interaction improve the accuracy of our Hartree-Fock wavefunction by including terms corresponding to excitations of electrons from occupied (i, j, k..) to virtual (a, b, c...) orbitals. This recovers some of the dynamic electron correlation previously neglected by Hartree-Fock.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is convenient to introduce new notation to succinctly express the complex mathematical expressions encountered in these methods. This tutorial will cover this notation and apply it to a spin orbital formulation of conventional MP2. This code will also serve as a starting template for other tutorials which use a spin-orbital formulation, such as CEPA0, CCD, CIS, and OMP2. \n",

    "### II. Kutzelnigg-Mukherjee Tensor Notation and the Einstein Summation Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Kutzelnigg-Mukherjee (KM) notation provides an easy way to express and manipulate the tensors (two-electron integrals, $t$-amplitudes, CI coefficients, etc.) encountered in post-HF methods. Indices which appear in the bra are expressed as subscripts, and indices which appear in the ket are expressed as superscripts:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper and lower indices allow the use of the Einstein Summation convention. Under this convention, whenever an indice appears in both the upper and lower position in a product, that indice is implicitly summed over. As an example, consider the MP2 energy expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{MP2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i a j b} \\frac{ [ia \\mid\\mid jb] [ia \\mid\\mid jb]} {\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_b}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Converting to physicist's notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{MP2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i j a b} \\frac{ \\langle ij \\mid\\mid ab \\rangle \\langle ij \\mid \\mid ab \\rangle} {\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_b}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where $\\mathcal{E}_{ab}^{ij}$ is the sum of orbital energies $\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_b$. Upon collecting every possible orbital energy sum into a 4-dimensional tensor, this equation can be solved with a simple tensor-contraction, as done in our MP2 tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation simplication here is minor, but the value of this notation becomes obvious with more complicated expressions encountered in later tutorials such as CCD. It is also worth noting that KM notation is deeply intertwined with the second quantization and diagrammatic expressions of methods in advanced electronic structure theory. For our purposes, we will shy away from the details and simply use the notation to write out readily-programmable expressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the MP2 tutorial, we used spatial orbitals in our two-electron integral tensor, and this appreciably decreased the computational cost. However, this code will only work when using an RHF reference wavefunction. We may generalize our MP2 code (and other post-HF methods) to work with any reference by expressing our integrals, MO coefficients, and orbital energies obtained from Hartree-Fock in a spin orbital formulation. As an example, we will code spin orbital MP2, and this will serve as a foundation for later tutorials.\n",
