    "As we saw in tutorial (5a), the single most expensive step for a conventional MP2 program using full ERIs is the integral transformation from the atomic orbital (AO) to molecular orbital (MO) basis, scaling as ${\\cal O}(N^5)$.  The scaling of this step may be reduced to ${\\cal O}(N^4)$ if we employ density fitting, as the three-index density fitted tensors may be transformed individually into the MO basis before being recombined to form the full four-index tensors in the MO basis needed by the MP2 energy expression.  This tutorial will discuss the specific challenges encountered when applying density fitting to an MP2 program.\n",

Furthermore, the formation of the $I_{ab}$ tensor is also ameliorated, since only the auxiliary-virtual blocks of the three-index `Qmo` tensor must be contracted, which can be done on-the-fly as opposed to beforehand (requiring no storage in memory).  In practice, these expressions can be used within explicit loops over occupied indices $i$ and $j$; therefore the overall scaling of this step is still ${\\cal O}(N^5)$ (formation of $I_{ab}$ is ${\\cal O}(N^3)$ inside two loops), however the the drastically reduced memory requirements result in this method a significant win over conventional MP2.\n",
