    "Moller-Plesset perturbation theory [also referred to as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)] is an adaptation of the more general Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory (RSPT), applied to problems in molecular electronic structure theory.  This tutorial will provide a brief overview of both RSPT and MBPT, before walking through an implementation of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (specifically referred to as MP2) which uses conventional, 4-index ERIs.  \n",
