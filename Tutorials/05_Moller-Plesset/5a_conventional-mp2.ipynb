    "Moller-Plesset perturbation theory [also referred to as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)] is an adaptation of the more general Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory (RSPT), applied to problems in molecular electronic structure theory.  This tutorial will provide a brief overview of both RSPT and MBPT, before walking through an implementation of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (specifically referred to as MP2) which uses conventional, 4-index ERIs.  \n",

    "The energies $E_n$ and wavefunctions $\\mid\\Psi_n\\rangle$ will both be functions of $\\lambda$; they can therefore be written as a Taylor series expansion about $\\lambda = 0$:\n",

    "\n",
    "With these choices of $\\hat{H}{}^{(0)}$, $\\hat{V}$, and $\\mid\\Psi_n^{(0)}\\rangle$, the ground-state zeroth-order energy is given by $E_0^{(0)} = \\sum_i\\epsilon_i$.  Then, the first-order ground state energy may be computed by $E_0^{(1)} = \\langle\\Psi_0^{HF}\\mid\\hat{V}\\mid\\Psi_0^{HF}\\rangle$ to find that the total ground-state energy through first order, $E_0 = E_0^{(0)} + E_0^{(1)}$, is exactly the Hartree-Fock energy.  Therefore, the first correction to the Hartree-Fock energy will occur at second-order in the perturbation series, i.e., with $E_0^{(2)}$; truncating the perturbation series at second order is commonly referred to as MP2.  The second order correction to the ground state energy will be given by\n",

    "For brevity, we will now drop the \"HF\" from all zeroth-order wavefunctions.  This summation is over the eigenstate index $\\mu$, each associated with a different eigenstate of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.  For a single-determinant wavefunction constructed from spin orbitals, the summation over the eigenstate index $\\mu\\neq 0$ therefore refers to determinants which are constructed from *different* spin orbitals than the ground state determinant.  To distinguish such determinants, we will denote MOs occupied in the ground state with indices $i,\\,j,\\,\\ldots$, and MOs which are unoccupied in the ground state with indices $a,\\,b,\\,\\ldots\\,$.  Then a determinant where orbital $a$ is substituted for orbital $i$ is denoted $\\mid\\Psi_i^a\\rangle$, and so on.  Before substituting this new notation into the above energy expression, however, we may immediately recognize that many terms $\\langle\\Psi_{0}\\mid\\hat{V}\\mid\\Psi_{\\mu}\\rangle$ will not contribute to the second order energy:\n",
