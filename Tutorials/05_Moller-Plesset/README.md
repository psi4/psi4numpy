Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory 
==================================

This module offers the following tutorials which seek to discuss the theory and implementation of Møller–Plesset perturbation theory:

- (5a) Conventional MP2: Introduces the theory of the conventional formulation of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and guides the reader through the implementation of a simple MP2 program.

- (5b) Density-Fitted MP2: Discusses the implementation of the density-fitted formulation of MP2 in a memory-saving and efficient algorithm which utilizes permutational symmetry of ERI tensors to reduce the total number of necessary computations.

## Planned tutorials:

- MP3: Introduces the theory and implementation of third order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory.
