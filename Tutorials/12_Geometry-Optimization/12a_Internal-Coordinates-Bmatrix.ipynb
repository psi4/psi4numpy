A stretching coordinate is added for every two bonded atoms, and a bending coordinate is added for all A-B-C sequences of connected atoms. Linear bends require special treatment that will not be shown here.  For this example of ammonia, there are no dihedral angles.

    "## Redundant Coordinates\n",
    "These simple internal coordinates have many advantages. They tend to produce a strongly diagonal energy second derivative matrix (Hessian), and they have force constants which are readily guessable, i.e., transferable from one molecule to another. In these two respects, they are vastly superior to Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, the primary difficulty is that the simple procedure demonstrated here generates too many coordinates. Non-linear molecules have 3N-6 internal degrees of freedom (where N is the number of atoms), but including all the internal coordinates defined by the bond connectivity will generally produce more than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ammonia, we see that we have 10 coordinates, while the ion has only 9 internal degrees of freedom. Various alternative coordinate systems were explored, for example \"delocalized coordinates\" [J.Baker, A. Kessi, and B. Delley, _J. Chem. Phys._, 105, 192 (1996)], and \"natural internal coordinates\" [G. Fogarasi, X. Zhou, P.W. Taylor, and P. Pulay, _J. Am. Chem. Soc._, 114, 8191 (1992)].  However, an elegant and robust solution turned out to be to simply work with a redundant set and to make the necessary mathematical adjustments.  This approach was advanced by P. Pulay and G. Fogarasi [_J. Chem. Phys._, 96, 2856 (1992)]."
