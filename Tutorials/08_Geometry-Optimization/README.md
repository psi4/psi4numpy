Geometry Optimization Theory
============================

At present, this module contains 4 tutorials introducing the most critical aspects of geometry optimization.

- (8a) This tutorial demonstrates how internal coordinates are generated automatically.  Their definition allows the construction of the Wilson B matrix necessary for transformations between Cartesian and internal coordinates.

- (8b) This tutorial demonstrates how Hessians are 'guessed', how they are updated, and how they may be transformed between Cartesian and internal coordinates.

- (8c) This tutorial demonstrates the Rational Function Optimization (RFO) method.  This enhanced Newton-Raphson (N-R) step method requires the gradient and the Hessian.  RFO is widely used, because it is superior to N-R at providing steps on surfaces which are not too far from quadratic in nature.

- (8d) This tutorial demonstrates how the backtransformation in internal coordinates is iteratively transformed into a step in cartesian coordinates, allowing for the next step in an optimization.
